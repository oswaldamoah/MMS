# Member Management System (MMS)

## Overview
Flourishing Field International Ministries (FFIM) required an efficient solution to manage member details, communicate vital information, and facilitate secure payments. The **Member Management System (MMS)** is a web-based solution designed to streamline these processes for both members and administrators.

- **Member Information Management**: Easy access and updates to member details.
- **Secure Online Payments**: Manage donations, event fees, and other transactions.
- **Event Registration**: Keep track of ministry events with simplified registration processes.
- **Announcements**: Provide real-time updates on ministry events and activities.
